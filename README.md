# Crime-Report

With Crime Report, you can make a record of a crime (title, date and photo). You can also identify a suspect from your contacts
and share the complaint via email, Facebook, Twitter or other apps.

## List-detail app

You might imagine that a list-detail application consists of two activities: one managing the list and the
other managing the detail view. Clicking a crime in the list would start an instance of the detail activity.
Pressing the Back button would destroy the detail activity and return you to the list where you could
select another crime.
